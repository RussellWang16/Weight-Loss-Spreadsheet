# Weight-Loss-Spreadsheet

During my weight loss journey, I wanted to refresh my Excel skills by creating a weight loss spreadsheet. I designed it to include some key calculations: a body fat percentage calculator, a daily goal weight tracker, a BMR calculator, and a resting calorie count. Realizing that not everyone's goal is to lose weight; some people want to maintain or gain weight. I knew that the spreadsheet would need to be able to accommodate different goals.

I also added macronutrient tracking for healthy intake, which allows the calculation of daily carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake. In creating this tool, I realized how much I was missing with Excel and thus learned about VLOOKUPs, IF statements, and even a little VBA to incorporate a working button. I was testing the spreadsheet with friends and found a huge mistake which was that I was using only imperial measurements. This required a complete rewrite to provide easy switching between imperial and metric units.

This spreadsheet truly helped with my weight loss journey. It allowed me to track my progress daily and weekly, and it kept me motivated as I lost almost 20 lbs that summer. To this day, I use it to track my weight fluctuations and make diet plans accordingly. Honestly, I strongly feel that if this tool worked for me, then it can work for anyone who aims at health and fitness.
